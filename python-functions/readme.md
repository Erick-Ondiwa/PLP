# Discount Calculator

This is a simple Python program that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount. The discount is only applied if it is **20% or more**. Otherwise, the original price is returned.

## Features

- Accepts user input for:
  - Original price of the item
  - Discount percentage
- Applies discount only if it's 20% or higher
- Displays the final price with or without the discount

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Run the program:

```bash
python discount_calculator.py

Enter the required details when prompted:

Original price (e.g., 1000)
Discount percentage (e.g., 25)

The program will display the final price based on the entered values.

## Example

Enter the original price of the item: 1500
Enter the discount percentage: 10
No discount applied. Final price: 1500.00


Enter the original price of the item: 1500
Enter the discount percentage: 25
Discount applied. Final price: 1125.00
