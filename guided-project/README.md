# 🦠 COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## 📘 Project Description

This project presents a data analysis notebook that explores global COVID-19 data from the [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus) repository. It tracks cases, deaths, and vaccinations over time across multiple countries and visualizes the data to uncover patterns and insights. This is an ideal project for practicing real-world data cleaning, exploration, and visualization using Python.

---

## 🚩 Objectives

- ✅ Import and clean real-world COVID-19 data
- ✅ Analyze trends over time (cases, deaths, vaccinations)
- ✅ Compare metrics across selected countries
- ✅ Visualize global and country-level trends using charts and maps
- ✅ Communicate insights clearly through a narrative data report

---

## 📁 Files Included

- `covid19_tracker.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing all code, analysis, and visualizations
- `README.md`: This file with project overview and instructions

---

## 📊 Tools & Libraries Used

- **Pandas** – for data loading and manipulation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for static visualizations  
- **Plotly Express** – for interactive choropleth map  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for code, documentation, and visualization integration

---

## 🔄 Dataset Information

- **Source**: [Our World in Data - COVID-19 Dataset](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv)
- **Fields Used**: `location`, `date`, `total_cases`, `new_cases`, `total_deaths`, `people_vaccinated`

---

## 📈 Key Visualizations

- Line chart of global case/death/vaccination trends
- Bar chart of top 10 most affected countries
- Line chart comparison between selected countries
- Choropleth map of total cases per country

---

## 📝 Summary of Findings

- The global number of COVID-19 cases and vaccinations continues to rise.
- The United States, India, and Brazil are among the most affected countries.
- Some countries exhibit effective vaccination efforts compared to others.
- Interactive and visual tools are critical for understanding pandemic dynamics.
