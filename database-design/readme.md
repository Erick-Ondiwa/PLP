# üõí E-Commerce Database Design

Welcome to our E-Commerce Database project! This project involves designing a robust and scalable relational database schema to support a full-featured e-commerce platform. It includes an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), SQL schema, and documentation for team collaboration and future development.

The ERD includes 12 interrelated tables representing various aspects of an e-commerce platform, such as products, images, variations, categories, sizes, and attributes.
