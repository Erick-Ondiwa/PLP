🏗️ Activity 1: Design Your Own Class — Book and EBook
This activity demonstrates object-oriented programming principles in Python through a custom Book class and an EBook subclass.

✅ Features:
Uses constructors to initialize book objects.

Applies encapsulation for data hiding.

Demonstrates inheritance (EBook extends Book).

Implements polymorphism by overriding methods.

📌 Sample Output:
csharp

📁 Files:
book_class.py – Contains Book and EBook class definitions and usage.

🎭 Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge — Vehicle and Subclasses
This activity explores polymorphism by defining a base Vehicle class and implementing the move() method differently in each subclass.

✅ Features:
Defines a common interface (move()) for all vehicles.

Subclasses override move() to provide specific behavior.

Demonstrates polymorphism via a single function vehicle_movement().

🚀 Sample Output:

📁 Files:
vehicle_polymorphism.py – Contains the vehicle classes and example usage.
